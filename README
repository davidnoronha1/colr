A simple color picker GUI for X11.

INSTALL & USAGE
---------------
$ git clone https://github.com/undefinedDarkness/colr.git 
$ cd colr
$ make
$ mv colr ~/.local/bin # Move to path

To use it, run: `colr`

Requirements:
Gtk3 Development Headers (libgtk-3-dev)
X11  Development Headers (libx11-dev)

While currently, complex picking behaviour is not supported, 
I recommend you use https://github.com/Soft/xcolor as a external color picking program.
